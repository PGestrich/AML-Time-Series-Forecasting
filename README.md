Here you can find a short overview and description of the files we created during the final AML project.

- create_data_sets.ipynb - this notebook creates the data sets that are used in the notebooks LSTM.ipynb, LSTM_mav.ipynb and VAR.ipynb. You have to run this first to get the right data for the other notebooks mentioned.
- visualize_data.ipynb - this notebook visualizes some data. Its more playing around and get a feel for the data
- VAR.ipynb - implementation of a vector autoregressive model
- Autoregressive_Model.ipynb - implementation of an autoregressive model
- LSTM.ipynb - implementation of a LSTM network
- LSTM_mav.ipynb - implementation of a LSTM network but trained on a different feature set (moving average included)
